# Code for: "Life at the Boundary of Chemical Kinetics and Program Execution"

(Author: T. Fischbacher, tfish@google.com)


This repository provides both the framework code as well as all the
scripts that redo calculations (and generate plots) presented in the
aforementioned article.

Running the code will require having GCC, Python, NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, JAX, and also Gambit-C installed. On Debian-based Linux
distributions, Gambit-C should be available via the `libgambit4-dev`
package.
